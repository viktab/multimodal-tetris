# Multimodal Tetris

### How to Play
1. Download the [Leap Motion SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) for your OS. Position the Leap sensor in front of your keyboard and run through a couple of the pre-packaged demos to make sure things are working properly.
2. Clone the repository to your device in a folder you can easily access. 
3. Run the webapp locally by navigating to the code directory in a terminal and running python -m http.server. Then, navigate to your web browser and go to localhost:8000. Be sure to enable microphone access, and click on the screen to ensure that the system can speak back to you.
4. Have fun!

** Be sure to run this in Google Chrome and play in a relatively quiet area to ensure that everything works properly.
